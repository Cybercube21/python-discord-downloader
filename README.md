# Python discord downloader


This is a little discord bot i wrote for downloading all attachements in one channel on start of the bot.

## Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```shell
clone https://github.com/Cybercube21/python-discord-downloader.git
cd python-discord-downloader
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To start, you first have to add a channel ID in "channel = client.get_channel()".\
It will scan the whole channel and download each attachement on default.\
You can set a limit for that aswell, just read the comment below the channel stuff.

This should be enough to get started.
